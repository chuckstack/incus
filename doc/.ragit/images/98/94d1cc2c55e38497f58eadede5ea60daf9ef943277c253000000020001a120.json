  "explanation": "The image shows a configuration interface for managing resource limits in a computing environment. It includes settings such as Exposed CPU limit, Memory limit, Memory swap, Disk priority, and Max number of processes for containers. Some settings are inherited from default profiles and can be overridden. The memory limit section allows switching between absolute and percentage values, with a total memory of 47.9 GiB noted."
