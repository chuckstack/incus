  "summary": "The 'pci' device type is used to pass raw PCI devices from a host to a virtual machine and is suitable for specialized single-function cards like sound or video capture cards. While it can be used for GPUs or network cards, it's generally better to use dedicated device types like 'gpu' or 'nic' for these. PCI devices for VMs do not allow hotplugging and have specific configuration options outlined in an external file.",
