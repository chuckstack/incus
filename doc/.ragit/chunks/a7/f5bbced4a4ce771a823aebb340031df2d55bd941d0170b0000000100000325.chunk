  "summary": "This section describes the `unix-char` device type, which is supported in container environments and allows for dynamic addition and removal (hotplugging). Unix character devices provide character-based device I/O within an instance under the `/dev` directory, permitting read and write operations. The document references configuration options from an external text and discusses hotplugging in detail.",
