  "summary": "External networks in Incus rely on pre-existing network interfaces. Incus has limited control over these networks, meaning features like network ACLs, network forwards, and network zones aren't supported. These networks serve primarily to provide an uplink through a parent interface, outlining the presets for connecting instances or other networks. Supported external network types include MACVLAN, SR-IOV, and physical networks.",
