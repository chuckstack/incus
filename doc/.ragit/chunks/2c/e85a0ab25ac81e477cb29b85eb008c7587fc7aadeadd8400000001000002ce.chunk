  "summary": "The `unix-hotplug` device type is available for containers, supporting hotplugging. This allows a requested Unix device to appear under `/dev` within the container instance, enabling read and write operations if the device exists on the host system. The functionality relies on `systemd-udev` running on the host. Configuration options for `unix-hotplug` devices are detailed and included via an external configuration file.",
